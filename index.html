            <p>
                Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) is a diversified automotive and farm equipment major 
with leadership positions across SUVs, tractors, and last-mile mobility, and a growing 
presence in electric vehicles. The company has delivered strong operating and 
financial performance, supported by premiumisation, market share gains in core 
segments, and a clear long-term electrification strategy. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The valuation in this report is carried out using a
                <strong>Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP)</strong> methodology to reflect the
                group’s diversified structure. The core automotive business is
                valued using a <strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong> model
                (mid-year convention), capturing long-term cash-flow generation driven by volume growth, 
margin expansion, and capital efficiency. Non-core investments and listed subsidiaries 
are valued separately based on their respective market capitalisations and M&M’s 
effective shareholding, with an appropriate holding company discount applied.

            <p>
                Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. is the flagship company of the Mahindra Group,
                operating across Automotive, Farm Equipment, and Services. The
                company participates in sectors contributing nearly 70% of India’s GDP
                and remains deeply aligned with the country’s long-term growth story.
            </p>

            <p>
                In FY25, M&M delivered record performance driven by strong demand
                in SUVs, tractors, and last-mile mobility, alongside rapid progress
                in its electric vehicle strategy under the “Born Electric” platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                M&M has established a strategic target for electric vehicles (EVs) to constitute 25-30% 
of its total sales volume by 2027 to ensure alignment with CAFE 3 norms. Management 
indicates that a more conservative EV portfolio penetration of 15-25% would suffice for 
comfortable compliance, primarily due to the significant 'super credits' generated by 
zero-emission vehicles in the regulatory framework.

            <h2 class="section-title">Industry Overview</h2>

            <p>
                The Indian automotive industry remains a primary engine of national economic growth, 
contributing over Rs. 20 lakh crore to the economy and accounting for approximately 
15% of India's total GST collections. India is currently the third-largest passenger 
vehicle market globally and a global leader in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler 
segments. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The industry showed steady performance in FY 2024-25, with total production reaching 
3.10 crore vehicles, up from 2.84 crore in the previous year. 
            </p>

            <p>
                 <strong> Vehicles / SUVs: </strong> 
            <p>
• SUV Dominance: SUVs now account for 64-65% of overall PV volumes. ICRA 
expects this preference to persist, driving a projected 4-7% growth for the PV 
industry in FY 2026. 
</p>
            <p>
            • Premiumization: There is a clear shift toward feature-rich, high-performance 
            vehicles, with luxury electric vehicles seeing high demand.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV):</strong>
                <p>
                    • The domestic LCV industry (cargo and passenger) recorded sales of 5.83 lakh 
units in FY 2024-25, representing a marginal de-growth of 2.0% compared to 
5.95 lakh units in FY 2023-24.   
                </p>
            </p>

            <p> 
                <strong>Tractors & Farm Equipment:</strong>
                <p>
                    • The Indian tractor industry achieved domestic sales of 9,39,713 units in FY 
2024-25, registering a solid growth of 7.3%. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    • Experts project that to achieve national foodgrain self-sufficiency, India’s 
tractor population must grow from the current 8.4 million to 17 million units by 
2030.

        <div class="assumption-item">
            <h4>Revenue Growth</h4>
            <p>
                Revenue growth assumptions are driven by volume expansion across
                SUVs, tractors, and electric vehicles, supported by stable market
                share, favourable product mix, and gradual improvement in realisations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="assumption-item">
            <h4>Margin Expansion</h4>
            <p>
                EBITDA margin expansion is assumed on account of operating leverage,
                premiumisation in the SUV portfolio, cost optimisation initiatives,
                and improving scale benefits in electric vehicle operations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="assumption-item">
            <h4>Capital Expenditure</h4>
            <p>
                Capital expenditure assumptions reflect continued investments in
                new product development, EV platforms, and capacity expansion,
                while maintaining capital discipline in mature segments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="assumption-item">
            <h4>Working Capital & Cash Flows</h4>
            <p>
                Working capital intensity is assumed to remain broadly stable,
                with improvements driven by inventory optimisation and disciplined
                receivables management, supporting healthy free cash flow generation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="assumption-item">
            <h4>Valuation Methodology</h4>
            <p>
                The company is valued using a Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) approach.
                The core automotive business is valued using a Discounted Cash Flow
                (DCF) methodology, while subsidiaries are valued based on market
                capitalisation adjusted for effective ownership and holding company discount.
